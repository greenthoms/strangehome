Yes Smile, based on the by cover art for Yes [Pet Shop Boys album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_(Pet_Shop_Boys_album)).

_The album sleeve was designed by Mark Farrow and Pet Shop Boys. The tick on the cover consists of 11 coloured squares, each one representing a track.[21] It was inspired by German artist Gerhard Richter (who is referenced in the album's opening track, "Love Etc.")._
